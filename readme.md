This repo contains the program for converting from a type of time-streams to a set of observables, by an statistical averaging operation. This is also used with a batch script for investigating the parameter-dependence of observables.

TODO: Add a description about its fundamental interface.

Notice: This repo have not been maintained for a long time. Makefile especially does not work properly. But the program itself *probably* works correctly.
